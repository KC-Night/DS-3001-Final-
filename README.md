# DS-3001-Final

This repo contains my DS 3001 final project. Working with a group, this project examined whether race, age, and underlying medical conditions influenced the likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. My particular contribution to this project was the coding of this project and the editing of our final research paper. Using the CDC’s COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data, I built predictive models to assess how demographic and health factors contributed to severe COVID-19 outcomes. I applied supervised learning techniques—including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest—using stratified cross-validation to address class imbalance and improve model robustness. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Results showed that underlying medical conditions were the strongest predictor of severe outcomes, followed by age, while race contributed less predictive power relative to other factors. These findings highlight how health vulnerabilities disproportionately shape COVID-19 outcomes and demonstrate how data-driven models can inform public health policy and resource allocation.
